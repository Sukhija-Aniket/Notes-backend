# Notes Application

## Description

This Notes Application is a full-stack project built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). It allows users to create, view, edit, and delete personal notes. This application demonstrates CRUD operations, authentication, and state management in a MERN stack environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Node.js and npm installed. Download and install them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- MongoDB installed and running on your local machine or use MongoDB Atlas for a cloud-based solution. See MongoDB's official [installation guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).
